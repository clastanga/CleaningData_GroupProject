Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobe’s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to create and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.

Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Lightroom CC, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.

We are building new machine learning platform, called Adobe Sensei, that powers machine learning and AI across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines. This platform will enable thousands of applied researchers, millions of users, and billions of content pieces. The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!

A crucial piece of developing machine learning solutions is the evaluation process. How do we know the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use for judging them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products – for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?

How can you participate? We’re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate evaluation for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of both A/B tests and human-judgment tasks to arrive at quantitative evaluations that measure how well our AI/ML algorithms are doing their jobs.

Responsibilities:

Work closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success
Design evaluation tasks and guidelines for human judgment to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.
Help design A/B tests for our cloud offerings, and use human judgment vs. end-user A/B tests as appropriate
Create a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!
Qualifications:

BS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a huna-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.
Exposure to applied machine learning in an industrial setting
Experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models
Strong quantitative orientation

Our data is at the heart of understanding the moments when mobile users are most receptive to ads.

This is a unique role that requires someone who has both business savvy and the ability to get their hands dirty with code. In this role, you will work alongside our Head of Data Science to develop marketing strategies that enable brands to deliver personalized messaging that match the personas of individuals. Mass broadcast advertising still has its place, but your recommendations will help heads of strategy, innovation, and marketing learn how to deliver messaging that captures the mindset of a person and provides them with advertising that they actually want.

Aki’s Data Science team works primarily in Python (with heavy use of Pandas) and SQL, but we also use other technologies that allow us to analyze several billions of rows of data. We do not use Tableau (nor others like it) so if these tools are a key source of your technical skills, this probably isn’t the right role for you. Also, this role is customer facing, so exceptional communication and storytelling capabilities are a must.

The role is too technical for most marketing analysts and too business-y for most data scientists. If you’re the rare individual who excels at both, then this is an amazing opportunity to show off your skills. Our ideal candidate will come from consulting with at least two years of experience using data to help clients improve their marketing or corporate strategies.

What You'll Do:

Wrangle and analyze very large data sets to extract insights for our clients
Develop tools for data pre-processing, information retrieval, and analysis automation
Develop presentations to deliver marketing strategies that “activate” new audiences to facilitate growth
Meet with clients to present recommendations and to generate new business for Aki
Write white papers to demonstrate deep marketing expertise in specific business verticals

Requirements:

2+ years of consulting (or similar) experience using data to help clients improve their marketing or corporate strategies
Strong grasp of Python for data manipulation and analysis
Business acumen and intuition that enable high quality hypotheses to explore
Excellent communication skills with ability to craft stories that convey Aki’s unique value proposition

We’re out to make the world a safer place by solving big problems and taking on the public safety challenges of our time. In the next 10 years, we’ll triple the amount of time officers can spend serving their communities. In the next 20, we’ll eliminate paperwork in policing so that officers can focus on what matters. And in the next 50 years, we’ll make the bullet obsolete.
It’s a big mission, but it’s one we’ll pursue relentlessly every single day.

Footage from body worn cameras and in-car footage is no ImageNet, or even a Youtube-8M for that matter. The domain is relatively unconstrained; the footage is extremely shaky, blurry, and spans day and night; the concepts we need to understand span all sorts of physical sizes and time scales; and most importantly, the cameras are never being “focused” on anything because there is no operator intentionally filming things. We have the challenging task of determining what a video is about as a whole, as well as creating a fine-grained temporal segmentation of all sorts of actions and small objects that are present on-screen at the same time.

Though it's difficult and unsolved, the impact of our work is immense-unlike most ML research in industry, the success of your models directly impacts the status quo of transparency and accountability in law enforcement.

In this role
You will be building automation for ML models from experimentation to production on large quantities of data across distributed environments.
You will drive core ML engineering via pairing with our Research Scientists to design experiments together and take leadership on implementation of new ideas behind those experiments.
You will take models that have worked well on smaller datasets and scaling and optimizing our ML pipelines and models to reach their full potential on the petabytes of footage at Axon.
You will continually read the state of the art of research, and work with research scientists to publish novel work (optional).
You will see that generalizable parts of your work get open-sourced.
Who you are
You have a strong background in High Performance Computing, Cloud Infrastructures, and GPU optimization.
You have a good understanding of the complete workflow from collecting and annotating the appropriate data for the task at hand to training models and evaluating their performance.
You easily implement research ideas in frameworks like Tensorflow/Keras/Torch/Caffe
You've had success in dealing with large datasets in a ML context
(Bonus) You have a strong background in ML, stats, or a related field. MS or MEng in vision, NLP, audio, stats, or ML preferred.

BetterUp has had incredible success building a business selling into Learning and Development teams inside of Fortune 1000 companies.

Today, BetterUp is preparing for exponential growth, and to reach those new audiences we are evolving our messaging and who we are talking to. BetterUp will be targeting more senior level HR executives, CHROs, CXOs inside of organizations who think and worry about employee retention and performance, and talent-obsessed CEOs.

From the start, we will try to minimize one-off, ad-hoc analyses, and instead focus on building the foundations for automating business decisions. The more we can automate recommendations (e.g. ""add lemon to this particular machine,"" ""order 50 more cartridges of cucumber concentrate for Seattle""), the better.
Requirements
We're open to various levels of experience, as long as you're able to jump in and add value quickly. In particular, we're looking for the following:

4448,"POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW, Quality of Medical Products at Boston University, USP Quality Institute","Boston University",299.0,"Boston","","Boston University (BU) and the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) Quality Institute have partnered to establish a fellowship program. This Request for Applications (RFA) seeks early career scientists and researchers who wish to receive specialized training, conduct novel research, and contribute to the evidence base on the value of quality medicines.

The Fellowship in Quality of Medical Products will foster the research, scholarship, and careers of individuals who are poised to work with academia, government, and industry to advance knowledge about the impact or value of quality medicines. Fellows will have the unique opportunity to engage in real-world training experiences, including interactions with USP scientific staff and other stakeholders.

The USP Quality Institute defines medicine quality as a balanced, risk-based set of pre-specified characteristics, systems, and requirements that consistently ensure a medicine’s delivery of stated and implied clinical outcomes for patients. This definition encompasses all aspects of a medical product’s lifecycle, including design, manufacture, supply chain, storage and distribution, as well as falsification. Excluded from this definition is the quality or appropriateness of treatment guidelines and practices.

Product quality can be designed into, improved, and reinforced all along the medicine continuum, from initial drug research all the way through to the dispensing of the medicines. These interventions differ for different products, product classes, and geographies, and have varying costs, feasibility, and outcomes. Assessing which interventions are most actionable and potentially effective is of critical importance to promote judicious policies and investment aimed at promoting medicine quality. USP has strong, trust-based relationships with quality professionals and healthcare policy makers globally, as well as several well-established offices and training centers in regions throughout the world. These strengthen USP’s understanding of local priorities and specificities, as well as its ability to effectively disseminate robust evidence and recommendations.

Research
The potential consequences of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are significant and may include massive loss of life, widening socioeconomic disparities, and significant economic shortfalls. Approximately 700,000 people from around the world die each year due to drug-resistant infections.1 Estimates of the potential economic impact of AMR are uncertain, but could be as large as a global, annual GDP shortfall of nearly $3.4 trillion by 2030.2

Antimicrobial resistance is driven, in part, by pathogens’ exposure to medicines of poor quality or delivering sub-therapeutic doses of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Sub-therapeutic doses drive AMR when drug concentrations in the body are too low to quickly eradicate the infection, but are high enough to create a reproductive advantage for resistant mutants by killing susceptible pathogens, often referred to as the “mutant selection window.” Poor-quality medicines may be the result of (1) products produced under quality standards but degraded due to inappropriate storage or distribution, or (2) products produced under poor-quality standards, whether inadvertently or intentionally. Regardless of the root cause, issues with medicine quality abound, with the World Health Organization recently reporting that approximately 10% of medicines globally are substandard or falsified, and 40% of those are antimicrobials.3

Fellowship applicants are asked to propose a research project that aims to address an important evidentiary gap in demonstrating the value of medicine quality related to issues of antimicrobial resistance. Examples of such gaps may include:
Measuring the extent to which poor-quality medicines contribute to the rise of AMR
Understanding how resistance develops and spreads in relationship to poor quality medicines
Assessing how policies or practices to reduce the prevalence of poor-quality medicines in a healthcare system impacts the onset of AMR (“bending the AMR curve”)
The benefits of delaying or reducing the onset of AMR for individuals (e.g., health outcomes), societies (e.g., population social mobility), countries (e.g., GDP), or the global community
The impact of quality-improving interventions at specific points along the medicine continuum
The resource requirements or costs of assuring antimicrobial medicine quality
Identifying actionable solutions (i.e., resource, regulatory, or policy) to improving the fraction of quality antimicrobial medicines, and defining strategies and approaches to address hurdles that impede these efforts

4448,"POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW, Quality of Medical Products at Boston University, USP Quality Institute","Boston University",299.0,"Boston","","Boston University (BU) and the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) Quality Institute have partnered to establish a fellowship program. This Request for Applications (RFA) seeks early career scientists and researchers who wish to receive specialized training, conduct novel research, and contribute to the evidence base on the value of quality medicines.

The Fellowship in Quality of Medical Products will foster the research, scholarship, and careers of individuals who are poised to work with academia, government, and industry to advance knowledge about the impact or value of quality medicines. Fellows will have the unique opportunity to engage in real-world training experiences, including interactions with USP scientific staff and other stakeholders.

The USP Quality Institute defines medicine quality as a balanced, risk-based set of pre-specified characteristics, systems, and requirements that consistently ensure a medicine’s delivery of stated and implied clinical outcomes for patients. This definition encompasses all aspects of a medical product’s lifecycle, including design, manufacture, supply chain, storage and distribution, as well as falsification. Excluded from this definition is the quality or appropriateness of treatment guidelines and practices.

Product quality can be designed into, improved, and reinforced all along the medicine continuum, from initial drug research all the way through to the dispensing of the medicines. These interventions differ for different products, product classes, and geographies, and have varying costs, feasibility, and outcomes. Assessing which interventions are most actionable and potentially effective is of critical importance to promote judicious policies and investment aimed at promoting medicine quality. USP has strong, trust-based relationships with quality professionals and healthcare policy makers globally, as well as several well-established offices and training centers in regions throughout the world. These strengthen USP’s understanding of local priorities and specificities, as well as its ability to effectively disseminate robust evidence and recommendations.

Research
The potential consequences of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are significant and may include massive loss of life, widening socioeconomic disparities, and significant economic shortfalls. Approximately 700,000 people from around the world die each year due to drug-resistant infections.1 Estimates of the potential economic impact of AMR are uncertain, but could be as large as a global, annual GDP shortfall of nearly $3.4 trillion by 2030.2

Antimicrobial resistance is driven, in part, by pathogens’ exposure to medicines of poor quality or delivering sub-therapeutic doses of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Sub-therapeutic doses drive AMR when drug concentrations in the body are too low to quickly eradicate the infection, but are high enough to create a reproductive advantage for resistant mutants by killing susceptible pathogens, often referred to as the “mutant selection window.” Poor-quality medicines may be the result of (1) products produced under quality standards but degraded due to inappropriate storage or distribution, or (2) products produced under poor-quality standards, whether inadvertently or intentionally. Regardless of the root cause, issues with medicine quality abound, with the World Health Organization recently reporting that approximately 10% of medicines globally are substandard or falsified, and 40% of those are antimicrobials.3

Fellowship applicants are asked to propose a research project that aims to address an important evidentiary gap in demonstrating the value of medicine quality related to issues of antimicrobial resistance. Examples of such gaps may include:
Measuring the extent to which poor-quality medicines contribute to the rise of AMR
Understanding how resistance develops and spreads in relationship to poor quality medicines
Assessing how policies or practices to reduce the prevalence of poor-quality medicines in a healthcare system impacts the onset of AMR (“bending the AMR curve”)
The benefits of delaying or reducing the onset of AMR for individuals (e.g., health outcomes), societies (e.g., population social mobility), countries (e.g., GDP), or the global community
The impact of quality-improving interventions at specific points along the medicine continuum
The resource requirements or costs of assuring antimicrobial medicine quality
Identifying actionable solutions (i.e., resource, regulatory, or policy) to improving the fraction of quality antimicrobial medicines, and defining strategies and approaches to address hurdles that impede these efforts

2378,"WATER UTILITY FINANCIAL ANALYST & RESEARCH FELLOW, Institute for Sustainable Energy, Questrom School of Business","Boston University",299.0,"Boston","","Topic: Water utility modeling that analyzes revenue stability and incorporates capital investments, focused on identifying utility business models that encourage sustainable water use while also being fiscally sustainable for the utility

Start Date: Immediately

Duration: Full-time, one-year position, with extension planned

Background

Water scarcity coupled with increasing population growth, increasing water demand, and declining infrastructure systems pose a threat to both the people of Texas and the vital freshwater inflow needed to feed sensitive bays and estuaries along the Gulf Coast. In order to increase water use efficiency in urban areas and enhance conservation of limited freshwater resources, many stakeholders are now considering fundamental changes in water management, including transitioning to integrated urban water management (IUWM) approaches such as ‘One Water.’

Boston University’s Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) is engaged in a multi-year project funded by the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation with the goal of assessing how siloed municipal water agencies in the state of Texas can transition to an IUWM model in order to increase water use efficiency in urban environments, revitalize aging infrastructure, and preserve freshwater inflow to the major bays and estuaries along the Texas Gulf Coast. ISE’s work is focused on integrated water utility financial modeling, and the model results will be used to establish recommendations of viable pathways to move to IUWM in Texas.

About the Institute for Sustainable Energy

The Boston University Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) is a university-wide center dedicated to facilitating the transition to a sustainable, climate-safe global energy system. Through interdisciplinary research, policy analysis, and collaborative engagement, our mission is to ensure that the energy systems of the world provide abundant, sustainable, and universally accessible energy services to both emerging and advanced economies. This enormous challenge will require new technologies and energy processes, new forms of financing and financial institutions, new policy approaches, and new forms of public governance, and new companies, industries, and markets. Our work spans all of the disciplines, departments, and colleges at BU and involves many partnerships with other researchers, policymakers, and industry. Core work areas comprise defining pathways to becoming the utility of the future in both the electric and water sectors, with a common theme of moving towards a business model based on electricity/water efficiency; emissions reduction in transportation; and city climate modeling.

Duties and Responsibilities

The Research Fellow will lead the development modeling work that builds on existing utility revenue models and incorporates analysis of maintaining revenue stability with capital investments factored in. The expanded model will incorporate key aspects of the One Water framework such as reuse, distributed water treatment and low impact development, and demand projection.

An expanded model will be a toolbox for utilities, providing analysis of different revenue and cost trajectories based on different urban water management strategies – including some that typically fall outside today’s utility framework. This can be a practical tool that supports effective implementation of integrated urban water management.

Specific responsibilities include:

Develop an analytical framework that enables assessment of various water utility business models based on the cost and revenue opportunities associated with holistic management of multiple types of water, including potable, graywater, blackwater, and stormwater.
Guide modeling work that enables quantitative analysis of an appropriate set of case studies representing different scenarios.
Produce, edit, and review technical reports, briefs, and presentations on modeling research.
Build strong relationships with key practitioners and stakeholders in the water industry in Texas and beyond.
Support communications with a National Advisory Committee associated with this project, and with the funder.
Pursue new project opportunities relating to water management and utility of the future.

Required Skills
The ideal applicant will have:

A PhD in a related field (e.g. energy/environmental sciences, energy engineering) is preferred. Candidates with a Masters degree in a related field or an MBA, plus substantial, relevant work experience may also be considered.
Expertise in water utility business models and best practices for infrastructure management.
Demonstrated experience designing, building, and using spreadsheet models for financial analysis.
A strong background in finance-related quantitative methods and data analysis.
Demonstrated project and task management capabilities, including supervising other staff and performing quality assurance on work products.
Strong leadership, management, technical, communications, and interpersonal skills.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs. Vital to igniting growth. Vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future of billions around the globe.

But, Innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees have lots of ideas on how to improve a business, but with no formal process, their suggestions go unheard and they give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation labs are expected to support countless different activities to promote innovation but lack the right tools for the job. Executives are seeing disruption everywhere they look and investing millions, but still have no idea where their “next big thing” will come from, or if it will come at all.

The KCO builds on breakthrough technologies such as single cell genomics (e.g. single-cell RNA-Seq) and on interdisciplinary collaborations across the Broad and beyond.
Advances in human genetics, spurred by genome wide association studies (GWAS), have provided critical new insights into the genetic basis of autoimmune disease. Beyond the GWAS era, fine mapping of disease risk loci and full exome sequencing have pinpointed specific genes and variants causally linked with disease. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial genomics, now provide an extraordinary opportunity for comprehensive identification of cells and their states associated with autoimmunity and how genetic variants impact disease phenotypes. This systematic approach stands to provide tangible clinical insights into how genetic variants influence disease pathophysiology and to inform innovative therapeutic approaches.
The study of human genetics promises to broaden our understanding of disease risk and pathological drivers of disease; however, there exist many limitations in connecting genetic loci to pathogenic traits. Immune cells reside within a complex multicellular ecosystem. The diversity of immune cells and their interactions affect disease progression and drug response and resistance, and present opportunities for more precise diagnostics and therapeutics. Therefore, there is an enormous need to chart an atlas of the cells that depends on expression and function of genetic variants, their spatial organization and functional relationships.

1556,"Computational Biologist","Broad Institute",32.0,"Cambridge","","We are looking for a highly motivated and talented individual with computational background to join the CGA Cancer Resistance team. We have undertaken an ambitious 5-year project aimed at discovering the basis of drug resistance in cancer. While cancer treatments (including chemo-, targeted- and immuno-therapies) work for months or years, cancers eventually recur. In most cancers and treatments, the causes of drug resistance are not yet understood.

There are a range of questions at the core of resistance: (i) What are the drivers of resistance ( genetic and/or epigenetic)? (ii) What are vulnerabilities of resistant cells? Novel therapies may exploit these vulnerabilities. We look for vulnerabilities using CRISPR, gene knockout, and small molecule screens of resistant and sensitive cell lines. (iii) Are there mutational mechanisms that contribute to development of resistance (e.g. APOBEC or MSI)? (iv) What can we learn from the dynamics of clones under drug selective pressure? Can we use sub-clonal structure and dynamics to identify multiple resistance mechanisms in a single patient? (v) Can we predict resistance mechanisms that will develop based on tumor type, treatment, genomics of tumor and patient i.e. can we find biomarkers of the resistance mechanism? (vi) In which cases can we predict effective therapy combinations based on the initial biopsy?

We plan to characterise the mechanisms of resistance through genetic characterization of patient tumor samples (germline, pre-treatment and post-resistance) and functional genomics using drug and CRISPR screens of cell lines. As a member or this team, you will collaborate with scientists and engineers in a collegial work environment with intellectual rigor. By applying your statistical and machine learning skills to multimodal cancer data, you will drive the generation and testing of hypotheses leading to new biological insights in cancer resistance.

 Together with other team members you will develop new methodologies for integrative analysis of functional and genomic data.
 Explore novel data representation modes with emphasis on integrating diverse data types.
 Analyses typically consist of the application or development of computational tools to a) assess data quality, b) characterize germline and somatic variants, and c) quantify how these variants impact tumor evolution and resistance to therapy.
 Present ideas and results to the multi-disiplinary members of the Cancer Genome Analysis Group. Prepare written reports and
presentations for internal use as well as presentations at conferences.

3070,"LINCS Postdoc Fellow","Broad Institute",32.0,"Cambridge","","Joint LINCS Fellow - Broad Transcriptomics and DCIC (Mount Sinai)
The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute has generated over 2M gene expression profiles

using the L1000 assay, while the LINCS DCIC has harmonized this data into several tools which feature

numerous complementary datasets. These efforts over the first 3 years of the Phase II of the LINCS

consortium have been very successful in making the data accessible and queryable. The clue.io portal,

developed by the Broad to access the LINCS L1000 data, has already accumulated over 1,500 users who

have executed thousands of queries in just the past 6 months. At the same time tools developed by the LINCS

DCIC, for example, the L1000 query app L1000CDS2 which appeared online since early 2016, has seen over

4,000 users so far who submitted over 400,000 queries.

In summary, users within and outside of the LINCS consortium are able to access and analyze the

L1000 data and now the challenge has moved to the interpretation and application of query results for

biological discovery.

One approach to tackle this challenge is to select a tractable number of biological hypotheses and conduct lab

experiments to validate hypotheses derived from LINCS analysis. While experimental validation is attractive in

principle, there are pragmatic hurdles—clearly there are more hypotheses from the LINCS L1000 data than

any one individual investigator can progress toward validation in their own web lab. Hence, our goal is to

develop concrete experimental follow-up workflows to guide the wider community how to proceed with

validation of L1000 inspired hypotheses. Ultimately, successful validation of even few hypotheses can serve

as convincing exemplars to the wider community about the quality of data and the methodologies developed by

the LINCS consortium.

By virtue of being in the midst of the core analytical teams at the Broad Center for Transcriptomics, and at the

LINCS DCIC, the LINCS fellow work will also include coordinating workshops, webinars, and other training and

outreach efforts that will bring more experimentalists to utilize LINCS resources for hypotheses generation.

Specific Tasks and Responsibilities for the LINCS Joint Fellow

Develop benchmarks for experimental validation of LINCS L1000 inspired hypotheses
Develop benchmarks for the L1000 imputation model; in particular assess ability to infer
knockdowns by shRNAs/CRISPRs of single genes. Generate synthetic RNA-seq data for all

L1000 conditions. Impute L1000 results for missing conditions. Employ advanced machine

learning algorithms including deep learning and compare those to simplers methods such as

PCA, linear regression, and elastic nets.

Using the MSigDB and Enrichr databases, develop a suite of well validated signatures that can
be tested on current algorithms and used to promote further analytical improvements. These

include transcription factor and kinase perturbations followed by gene expression analysis using

microarrays, RNA-seq and L1000. Such datasets can be used for benchmarks by asking which

method recovers the kinase substrates or transcription factor targets more robustly. This task

will require manual curation of published studies.

Extend the L1000 data to unaddressed areas of biology
L1000 probes are human specific, but there is a lot of useful perturbational response data
collected from model organisms. It would be useful to develop procedures that will enable

researchers working on a non-human system to query LINCS L1000 data. The fellow will
develop a human ortholog automatic conversion system to prioritize L1000 signatures for

queries from expression signatures from Mouse, Rat, Worm, Fly, Zebrafish and Yeast.

Develop biologically intuitive visualizations of the L1000 perturbation data; assess regions within
these maps that are densely populated with small-molecule profiles and areas that are

untouched by the current pharmacopeia.
Experimental workflows
Identify interesting relationships between drugs and genes by matching drug perturbations with
single gene perturbations. Explore connections through literature review and consistency across

cell lines, concentrations and assays.

Identify secondary (lower throughput) assays that can be used to validate L1000 inspired
hypotheses. These would range from straightforward measures of mRNA (e.g., RT-PCR) to

phenotypic assays to animal models. Write protocols for specific examples.

Progress at least 10 compound/genes through secondary assays by performing such
experiments at the Broad Institute. Cost for such experiments will be covered by other funds

and technical assistance will be provided.
Mentoring Plan

The LINCS fellow will be based at the Broad Institute but will be traveling for short visits to Mount Sinai every

four months, and potentially to other DCIC sites. The fellow will be jointly supervised by Drs. Subramanian and

Ma’ayan who will be meeting with the fellow jointly in three-way meetings for one hour bi-weekly. The fellow

will also participate in all laboratory meetings weekly at both sites. The Ma’ayan Lab meetings will be joined

through video conferencing. Dr. Golub, co-PI of the Broad center, and a clinician, will advise on approaches to

experimental follow-up. The fellow will be asked to take the Coursera LINCS course online as part of their

training. The fellow will also participate in all LINCS and BD2K related face-to-face meetings, general activities,

and working group calls. The fellow will present their progress through those venues as platform presentations,

posters and webinars. It is expected that not all goals listed above will be achieved during the time period.

Different aspects of the project will be advanced based on the fellow’s skill set, interest, and potential impact.

Qualifications

A minimum of a Ph.D. in molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology or related field
In-depth understanding of nucleic acid and protein biochemistry
Prior hands-on experience with nucleic acid and protein purification, experimental synthetic and
systems biology, molecular biology, and assay development are preferred, but any exceptionally

creative and driven scientist interested will be thoroughly considered

We are seeking a senior scientist to be take on the role of Cancer Resistance Scientific Lead and join the leadership of the project. This role will be at the interface of collaborating clinicians/hospitals and cancer scientists (both computational and experimental). While many cancer treatments work for months or years, most cancers eventually recur, and acquired drug resistance is a major cause of cancer death. In most cancers and treatments, the causes of drug resistance are not understood. This project will work to characterise the mechanisms of resistance through: (i) genetic characterization of patient tumor samples before treatment and after becoming resistant; and (ii) functional genomics using drug and CRISPR screens of cell lines.

We are looking for a highly motivated, creative, and talented individual with an understanding of cancer biology and drug resistance to join the leadership of this project. The role will include identifying key scientific questions and the collaborators, patients and samples needed to answer these questions, as well as planning, monitoring and executing the acquisition of these patient cohorts to ensure that we have maximal impact on understanding and overcoming drug resistance.

5163,"Research Scientist I - Lander Lab","Broad Institute",32.0,"Cambridge","","This position is a unique opportunity to join a new initiative at the Broad Institute to pursue innovative and cutting-edge edge approaches to study the molecular and cellular basis of common human diseases. We seek to understand fundamental principles by which genetic variation affects human traits, and apply these insights to understand the molecular and cellular basis of common diseases.

Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of loci that influence genetic risk for common human diseases, including heart disease. Each of these loci may harbor a biological insight to guide therapeutic development, if only we could understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which these regions affect human disease risk. However, it has proven challenging to dissect these underlying mechanisms, and to identify the causal variant, gene, cell type, pathway, and physiological function. Nonetheless, a convergence of new datasets and technologies — ranging from genetics, single-cell methods, and CRISPR — suggest new possibilities for tackling this problem at scale.

We are looking for a talented research scientist to join our team. The successful candidate will lead and design integrated experimental/computational projects that will push the boundaries of human genetics and reveal the functions of genetic variants associated with heart disease.

3653,"Data Scientist","CA Technologies",726.0,"Boulder","","Do you want to help eliminate barriers between ideas and business outcomes? We want you to bring your unique experiences and creative ideas to the table. CA Technologies provides software and solutions that help our customers to develop, manage, and secure complex IT environments to increase productivity and enhance competitiveness in their businesses. It’s our aim to encourage global collaboration and results-oriented innovation, while supporting and developing our talented people and our communities. CA Technologies will empower you to drive authentic success, for both the business and yourself in the application economy.
At CA Technologies’ R&amp;D Innovation Center in Boulder, Colorado, we build products like CA Agile Central, formerly known as Rally. Our product enables companies to become modern software factories, morphing from slow-moving bureaucracies into places where trust, innovation, and rapid response to changing customer demands are the norm. We think that radically transforming the way software is built and delivered is pretty exciting, and we’re looking for data scientists who want to join the fun.
As an Agile Central data scientist at CA Technologies, you will work with our product, engineering, user experience, and sales teams to draw insights from product usage and customer data. Your discoveries will inform:
Customer-facing features such as predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and sentiment analysis that enable our customers to be more successful with their agile efforts.
Product decisions based on feature adoption and usage, along with customer feedback.
Opportunities for improving the performance of Agile Central.

What would you be doing?
Building product features that use customer behavior and agile work product data (stories, defects, epics) to surface actionable insights that help customers use Agile Central more effectively, assist them with predictions and forecasts, and ultimately become better at the whole “concept to cash” cycle of product development.
Collaborating with stakeholders spanning all aspects of our business, exploring and analyzing performance and usage metrics of SaaS services, using Python, R, Splunk, and Spark, and explaining the resulting insights.
Helping maintain and improve the Kafka-based infrastructure that collects usage and performance data, summarizes and warehouses it, and makes it consumable using platforms like Splunk and Shiny.

What makes you a good fit?
The main things we’re searching for are talent and passion. However, experience in certain areas could help you hit the ground running, so here’s our attempt at narrowing things down a bit:
You are proficient in at least one programming language, preferably Python or R. We also use Scala, Clojure, and Ruby, so experience in any of those is a bonus.
You have professional experience developing predictive models, using machine learning, that support customer-facing features. If the product you worked on was a multi-tenant SaaS (software as a service) product, that’s even better.
You’re fluent in SQL.
You have a solid understanding of statistical concepts.
You’re able to perform sampling, clustering, and classification on large data sets.
You have used several of the following tools and technologies: Jupyter notebooks, Shiny, Splunk, Kafka, R/dpylr, Apache Spark, Amazon web services, Docker
You have used D3 or other visualization frameworks to visualize complex data sets in new and creative ways.
You have worked with large data sets, on the order of many terabytes, with tens of millions of new rows added per day.

Some of the reasons our engineers love it here:
Hackathons: Unleash your creativity with regular opportunities to prototype your ideas with whatever cool new tech interests you, and present it to the rest of the business. Many hackathons have become full-fledged parts of our products.
A Learning Environment: Our experiment-rich culture has us evolving our methodology and tools constantly. We encourage people to attend and present at conferences and meetups.
Collaboration: Our teams work closely together in agile style, enabling us to learn from each other rather than getting trapped in silos.
Influence: Every team member is empowered and encouraged to make things better - the product, the technology, the processes, and the culture.
Location: With a thriving tech scene, 300 days of sunshine, 300 miles of dedicated bikeways, and an abundance of outdoor adventure opportunities, Boulder is an amazing place to live. And it gives CA the opportunity to pay for a Boulder/Denver ski day every year.
Work/life balance: We take this one seriously, and work hard to make the pace sustainable.
